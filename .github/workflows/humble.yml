# This is workflow for humble distribution
name: humble

# Currently ros2ai supports all distribution with rolling branch, this is intentionally done.
# Unless it becomes necessary, we will keep the rolling branch for every distribution.
# So that we do not have, dependencies, backport, these maintenance extra cost.

  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

  # each job goes for each ros supported distribution.
  # each job description absorb the distribution dependency as much as possible,
  # so that build verification script can be agnostic from distribution dependency.
